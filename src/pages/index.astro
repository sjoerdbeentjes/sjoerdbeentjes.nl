  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>I'm a front-end developer working at De Voorhoede, where we focus on innovative web development. My main interest lies in building and integrating design systems across different front-end frameworks. It's a job that combines creativity with logic, and I really enjoy the process.</p>
  <p>Apart from coding, I'm based in the Netherlands and love to spend time outdoors. Trailrunning and hiking are my go-to activities for clearing my mind and staying active.</p>
  <p>Feel free to look around my website and get in touch if you'd like to discuss front-end development or share a favorite hiking trail!</p>
